#Preparación y configuración

In the Scrips folder you will find a short script with the creation of the tables and some test data (you will also find a little DER for the database).

In the front-end application under the assets folder you can find the config file for the application, in that file we will configure the url for our API.

The same, from the API side we need to set our parameters to setup CORS in order to work with our front-end.
